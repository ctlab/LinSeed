  samples = 40,
  genes = 12000,
  cellTypes = 3,
  bias = NULL,
  spearmanThreshold = 0.5,
  pureGenes = 0,
  noiseDeviation = 0,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{samples}{number of samples}

\item{genes}{number of genes}

\item{cellTypes}{number of cell types}

\item{bias}{if not null bias should be a number in between 0 and 1, one of cell types presented in mix will be more abundunt and one cell type will be less abundunt}

\item{spearmanThreshold}{Spearman treshold that has to be between generated samples}

\item{pureGenes}{number of genes which are not noisy}

\item{noiseDeviation}{standart deviation of normally distributed noise value}

\item{sampleLogMean}{average log expression of pure samples}

\item{sampleLogSd}{standard deviation of log expression of pure samples}

\item{removeAngles}{if TRUE there will be no signature genes in the mix (simplex corners will be removed)}

\item{cutCoef}{if removeAngles == T how much to cut angles}

\item{removeBorders}{if TRUE where will be no genes close to simplex border}

\item{borderShift}{number in between 0 and 1, every value in basis is guaranteed to be at least borderShift}
